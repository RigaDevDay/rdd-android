Emailing the developer who commited the last code changes, they send back the classic response... “It works on my machine”. *sigh* Is this scenario a recurring nightmare (and reality) for you? While everyone else is talking about “continuous delivery” do your deployments feel more like an extreme game of Jenga, tittering on the brink of disaster and a nightmare to reconstruct? It doesn’t have to be like this. Launched only two years ago, Docker has revolutionised application deployment. Using this open-source project, applications are packaged into lightweight containers, that are hardware and platform agnostic. Containers move from the local developer machine to a production server and then the cloud without modification! So, how do you migrate a traditional three-tier Java web application to use Docker? Let’s use a sample web application, designed for hosting on a single server, convert it to use Docker and deploy to a cloud platform. We’ll break out the application and component services into individual containers that can be ran and scaled independently. Showing you how to utilise existing pre-built images for rapid development, build custom container images for your application and move seamlessly between deployment platforms, enabling us to use “cloud” to accelerate application development. We will configure automatic build, test and deploy pipelines for continuous deployment and auto-scaling to handle unpredictable application traffic with ease. If you’re an application developer who’s exhausted from battling deployment issues, maintaining ”special” production servers and lives in fear of being on ”pager duty”, come and learn how you can use Docker to banish “works on my machine” syndrome. This talk is for developers who’ve heard about this “Docker thing” and want to see a practical example of converting a traditional monolithic web application to use Docker containers deployed to a scalable cloud platform.",

This will enable you to perform your own SQL “magic” and apply these principles when building Oracle database applications.\n<br><br>\nThis session is intended for developers, DBAs and data modelers looking to expand their SQL skills, highlighting features that are new to 12c as well as little used existing options.",

This removes a lot of JPA pain, which makes database interactions fun again. On a practical level we take a look at the available annotations and how to map your objects as well as how to easily query data in MongoDB. Next we discuss some patterns on how to solve common requirements, such as the proper use of generics, auto-increments, and the encryption of sensitive data. The talk concludes with some tips and lessons we've learned from using Morphia in production for three years.",

It can help you reduce the amount of code you write for Android applications and at the same time make it readable and more maintainable. In this session we are going to talk a bit why JetBrains sees the potential in Kotlin comparing to other JVM languages. Then we’ll see how certain language constructs can be used to make Android more enjoyable.

Then we will progress on how to automate your AWS setup. Ansible can configure your network, databases, caches, instances, or firewall rules in an automated and documented fashion. So you will never have to ask the question again: 'Why did I add this specific security rule a year ago? Does anyone still remember? Do we still need it?!'
